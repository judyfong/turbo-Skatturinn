# Turbo Skatturinn
software that works for both USA and Icelandic taxes for business owners

The financial software is primarily focused on personal financial software that generates a USA tax liability form and imports information 
from the Icelandic tax reporting authority. We are willing to pay a maximum of 1 million ISK for the first year of operating expenses. The 
idea is to replace the Mint personal finance software or YNAB (You need a budget). An Icelandic competitor would be Meniga. There is also 
Firefly III financial software. The goal is to earn 20,000 USD the first year and have a ten-fold increase for next year. of just Icelandic 
customers. If we include other european customers like Czech, England, or Germany then it might be a hundred fold increase.
